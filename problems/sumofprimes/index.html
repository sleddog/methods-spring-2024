    <h1>Methods 2024 - Problem - Sum of Primes</h1>
    <p>
    Write a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all prime numbers up to and including n. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, if n=10, the function should return 17, as the prime numbers up to 10 are 2,3,5,7 and their sum is 17
