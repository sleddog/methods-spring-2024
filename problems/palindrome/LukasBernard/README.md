To run the program using the shell script you will need to run the command 'chmod +x runPalindrom.sh' in your terminal.

Next you will be able to run the program using './runPalindrom.sh'

You will be prompted to enter a string that you wish to have checked for palindromic properties.

-----Tests-----

To run the test cases on the program using the shell script you will need to first enter the working directory, and type the command 'chmod +x runTests.sh' into the command line.

Next you will now be able to run the tests using './runTests.sh'

------Webpage------
To open the flask server for the webpage it is as simple as running the python file itself. Intially in your terminal type 'python3 palindrome.py' (or 'python palindrome.py' if you do not use python3). This will launch the server which is connected to my web page. In your terminal you will see a server route, (likely 'http://127.0.0.1:5000'). Enter this into the search bar of your browser and hit enter. Now you should be able to access the website. 

Within the web page there will be a form near the bottom under the title 'Run Palindrome.' Here you will be able to enter whatever word you would like to check for its palindromic properties, and then hit the 'check' button. A result will be returned if the Flask server was set up properly. You will be able to do this as many times as you'd like as long as the server is still running.

To end the server processes within your terminal, simply select your terminal and press "CTRL + C."
