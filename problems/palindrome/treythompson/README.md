Methods 2024 Trey Thompson Palindrome Solution

This repository contains a solution to determine whether a given string is a palindrome or not. The solution includes an HTML document presenting the solution and instructions on how to use it, along with a Python script that performs the palindrome check.

The Python script runPalindromeCheck.py contains the logic for determining whether a given string is a palindrome. It defines a function isPalindrome(arg) that takes a string argument and returns whether it is a palindrome or not.

To run the script, execute it from the command line with the string you want to check as an argument.

There is a unit test for the palindrome function. The tests will ensure that the palindrome function returns the correct result and when it returns an argument error.

NodeJS documentation for assignment 6:
The web app is a simple NodeJS application that hosts a web server that can be used to run a palindrome checker in an HTML document that will communicate with the app.js backend. This will call the palindrome function in the palindrome.py file and return whether the text is a palindrome or not.
