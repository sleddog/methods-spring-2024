# Alex Ellingsen's Unique Char Solution

This function takes any string as an input and returns "True" or "False" depending on if there are any repeated characters in the string.

To run the script, use the command "./run.sh". You will then be prompted to enter a string, and then "True" or "False" will be printed.

If there are any errors running the shell script, try changing "python" in run.sh to "python3".
