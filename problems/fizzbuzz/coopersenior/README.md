## Problem - FizzBuzz - Cooper Senior

This function takes in an input n and prints the numbers from 1 to n.
If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints 'Fizz' instead.
If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints 'Buzz' instead.

To run this program navigate to the folder with the 'run.sh' 
script file and run `./run.sh n` with 'n' being an integer. 

```
Example output with n=17:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16

```

To run this program navigate to the folder with the 'test.sh' script file and
run `./test.sh`.  

To run the front end web app navigate to the folder containing 'backend.py'. Run 'python3 backend.py' and 
make sure that flask is installed. To install flask I had to run 'pip3 install flask' on my mac. Once the 
server starts running go to the port it is running on to interact with the app.
