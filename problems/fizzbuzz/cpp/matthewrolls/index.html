    <h1>FizzBuzz Problem - Matthew Rolls</h1>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p><a href="fzbz-mr.cpp">My FizzBuzz Solution</a></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    This program takes in an input number greater than 0 from the user and then prints all numbers from 1 to the input number with 3 exceptions.<br/>
    If the current number is a multiple of 3, it will print Fizz instead of the current number.<br/>
    If the current number is a multiple of 5, it will print Buzz instead of the current number.<br/>
    Finally, if the current number is a multiple of 3 and 5, it will print FizzBuzz instead of the current number.<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
    To run the fizzbuzz solution simply enter ./script.sh into your shell which will then compile fzbz-mr.cpp into the <br/>
    executable fzbz-mr and will run it. You will then be prompted for a number. Simply enter a number greater than 0 and <br/>
    the program will run and solve fizzbuzz up to that number.<br/>
    <br/>
    Note: Make sure to enter chmod +x script.sh beforehand to ensure it has the neccessary permissions to run properly.
