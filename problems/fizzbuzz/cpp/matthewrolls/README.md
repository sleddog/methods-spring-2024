##FizzBuzz Problem - Matthew Rolls

To run the fizzbuzz solution simply enter ./script.sh into your shell which will then compile fzbz-mr.cpp into the executable fzbz-mr and will run it. You will then be prompted for a number. Simply enter a number greater than 0 and the program will run and solve fizzbuzz up until that number.

In order to test the program simply enter an integer less than 0 on the commandline.

Note: Make sure to enter chmod +x script.sh beforehand to ensure it has the neccessary permissions to run properly.
