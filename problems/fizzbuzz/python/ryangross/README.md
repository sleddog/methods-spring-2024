Ryan Gross - FizzBuzz Solution

This folder contains a solution to the FizzBuzz Problem. 
To run fizzbuzz.py with run.sh, make sure both files are in the same folder. 
Simply use the following command: bash run.sh <Integer>

test.py tests the correctness of what value is printed when an int is a multiple of 3, 5, or neither

test.py can be run directly with the prefix 'python' or 'python3' or can be run with 'bash run_tests.sh'
