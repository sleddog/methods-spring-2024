## Problem - FizzBuzz - Cooper Senior

This function takes in an input n and prints the numbers from 1 to n.
If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints 'Fizz' instead.
If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints 'Buzz' instead.

To run this program I had to change the permissions of the script
to allow execution by running `chmod +x fizzbuzz.py`. To run this
program navigate to the folder with the 'run.sh' script file and
run `./run.sh n` with 'n' being an integer. 

```
Example output with n=17:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
```

To run test the program I created a test.sh file. To first run it I had to change the permissions of the script
to allow execution by running `chmod +x test.py`. To run this
program navigate to the folder with the 'test.sh' script file and
run `./test.sh`. Testing this program is a intersting since it is a long string designed to be printed output.
