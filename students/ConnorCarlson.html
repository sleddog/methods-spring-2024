        <p>
            I am a Senior in Computer Science. I am from Bremerton Washington and moved here to Bozeman in 2017.
            I like movies, video games, hiking, and just learning and experiencing new things. Planning on this
            being my last semester and after graduation I plan to stick around here in Bozeman and work for a
            while. I would like to move somewhere else eventually but not sure where, so I want to do some
            traveling and exploring first.
